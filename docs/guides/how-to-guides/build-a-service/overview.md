title: Setting up a gRPC server

# Tutorial overview

:::tip
It is highly recommended that you first read the overview of the [developer flow](../../getting-started/developer-flow)
before getting started with this tutorial.
:::

In this tutorial, the entire [developer flow](../../getting-started/developer-flow) is demonstrated with a simple `BooksService` example.
The tutorial is broken into three parts:
1. **Design** - the design of the service usign protocol buffers;
2. **Implement** - the implementation of the business logic and infrastructure requirements; and
3. **Deploy** - the deployment of the service to serve traffic.

Throughout this example, we will use the "Example Organisation" (with id `xmpl`), the "Books Repository"
product (with id `br`) and neuron `resources-books-v1`. The domain for this organisation is "example.services" -
please be sure to adapt the example commands to your organisation and product.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes a conceptual understanding of both [protocol buffers](../../references/core-technologies#Protocol buffers) and [gRPC](../../references/core-technologies#grpc).

Furthermore, to follow in your own development environment, ensure that you have:
1. Installed and set up the [Alis CLI](../../getting-started/command-line-interface);
2. Have an existing [product](/guides/getting-started/conceptual-framework.html#product) that you are able to build in.
